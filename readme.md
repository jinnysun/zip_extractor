# Zip Extractor
A simple script to extract all files of a certain filetype from many .zip files

Place this file in the folder where you have all your zipfiles.

Example use:
- To extract only PDFs: `extract_filetype('.pdf', '/folder')` where /folder is the dir you store your zipfiles
- 2nd argument is optional (defaults to ./)
